# Ink Point
This project started out as a full E-commerce platform hence the name OnlineMall but later was narrowed down to only Stationery products and the name became Ink-point. 
It is an online website for a Stationery store depicting all the various categories of products available as well as the products.

Users are allowed to create an Account with this site to acces some sections such as Orders, Cart, Notebox.

<h3>Orders</h3>
The fact that the platform allows users to browse through various products, they can as well place orders fro whatever products they want.
This would involve then filling a form with required details such as:<br>
*Phone number,<br> 
*their location,<br> 
*their preffered method of payment and<br>
*the Quantity 

<h3>Cart</h3>
Other than place an order, a user maybe be interested in a product but unable to purchase it at the momment. He/she can add these products to cart and keep track of them so that any time they are ready, they can easily access them and place the orders.

<h3>Reviews</h3>
Each product has a review section where any user can share their experience with the product so that other users can use these info to judge whether to go for  aproduct or not. It is super open and any user can share anything hower insignificant it may look about any product.
